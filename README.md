# WindForecastingCompetition

This repository contains all the scripts, functions and classes used for the project "Wind power forecasting: Leveraging deep learning for intra-day predictions with applications in energy trading". The deep learning framework used for developing the models was PyTorch (and a few utilities from TensforFlow were used).
 
The work is based on the data of "Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 - Wind Forecasting" (Kaggle) and was the final project of the Deep Learning course from DTU compute (grade: 12/12).


The full report can be found in the main directory of the repository ("Deep_report_LAST_VERS.pdf")
